USA Housing Price Prediction Model

In this Jupyter notebook, we are going to develop a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses in the USA. The prediction will be based on various features from a dataset sourced from Kaggle.

Dataset Features

The dataset comprises the following features:

Avg. Area Income: The average income of the residents in the area.

Avg. Area House Age: The average age of the houses in the area.

Avg. Area Number of Rooms: The average number of rooms for houses in the area.

Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms: The average number of bedrooms for houses in the area.

Area Population: The population in the area.

Price: The price of the houses, which is the target variable we aim to predict.

Address: The address of the houses, which is a textual feature and will not be used in the model.

The dataset contains 5,000 entries, with no missing values reported for any of the numeric features.

Steps

Import Essential Libraries: We will start by importing libraries essential for data manipulation (Pandas, NumPy), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and modeling (Scikit-learn).

Data Exploration: Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we'll gain insights into the dataset's characteristics and distributions.

Data Preprocessing: This includes cleaning the dataset, handling non-numeric data, and preparing the features for model training.

Model Training: We will train the linear regression model on the processed data to predict house prices.

Model Evaluation: Finally, we'll evaluate our model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc., and validate the model using a separate test dataset.

Results

The model achieved the following performance metrics:

- MAE: 82288.22
- MSE: 10460958907.21
- RMSE: 102278.83
